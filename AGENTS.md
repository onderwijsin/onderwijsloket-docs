# AGENTS.md

> **Operational contract for coding agents working in this repository**

---

## Before You Start

1. Understand the user's request precisely.
2. Identify which systems or files are affected.
3. Read only the relevant documentation under `docs/`.
4. Inspect existing implementations before introducing new patterns.
5. Keep changes as small as possible.

---

## How to Decide

### Design Priorities

When multiple valid solutions exist, prefer:

1. Correctness
2. Small changes
3. Existing patterns
4. Readability
5. Type safety
6. Performance

### Hard Rules

- **MUST NOT** introduce breaking UX or API-shape changes without explicit request
- **MUST NOT** edit files under `.husky/**` unless explicitly requested in the current task
- **MUST NOT** edit files under `modules/*/runtime/types/**` — use `runtime/server/` for type
  augmentation
- **MUST NOT** edit anything under `.agents/skills/**` unless explicitly requested
- **MUST NOT** add dependencies unless explicitly requested and demonstrated to improve codebase
  health and quality
- **MUST NOT** create, configure, or use a repository-local PNPM store such as `.pnpm-store/`
- **MUST NOT** set `store-dir` to a path inside the repository, whether via config, environment
  variable, or CLI flag
- **MUST NOT** run `pnpm install` or any command that mutates `node_modules` or the lockfile unless
  the current task explicitly requires dependency or package-manager work
- **MUST** use the project-pinned package manager via Corepack when running PNPM-related commands
- **MUST** prefer inspection commands that do not modify dependency state when dependency changes
  are not part of the task
- **MUST** wrap JSON API responses with `useApiResponse(...)`
  - _Exception_: Passthrough/proxy/streaming routes returning raw upstream responses
- **MUST** use Zod for boundary validation where applicable

### Package Manager Contract

- This repository is pinned to the package manager declared in `package.json`
- Agents must invoke PNPM as `corepack pnpm ...` instead of plain `pnpm ...`
- Agents must treat any untracked or modified `.pnpm-store/**` content as a problem to avoid, not as
  a normal byproduct of their work
- Agents must not add `.npmrc` settings, shell exports, or command flags that redirect the PNPM
  store into the repository
- If dependency work is explicitly required, agents must keep the existing lockfile and
  `node_modules` topology stable unless the requested change genuinely requires updates
- If PNPM store behavior is unexpected, agents must stop and report the cause instead of continuing
  with more package-manager mutations

### Working Principles

- Prefer extending existing implementations over introducing new abstractions
- Keep presentational concerns in components and reusable logic in composables
- When repository conventions are unclear, inspect nearby code before inventing a new pattern
- Verify real runtime behavior from code before changing documentation or implementation
- Read only the documentation relevant to the files or systems you are modifying
- Keep scope tight — avoid opportunistic refactors
- Preserve existing route and file naming contracts unless explicitly asked to change them

---

## When to Ask

Ask for clarification instead of guessing when:

- Requirements are ambiguous
- Multiple architectural directions are equally valid
- The requested change could break compatibility

---

## Documentation

**`docs/` is the single source of truth.**

When working on...

- architecture → `docs/architecture.md`
- runtime configuration, environment, deployment → `docs/runtime.md`
- modules → `docs/modules.md`
- environment management (Varlock, Proton Pass) → `docs/environment.md`
- API contracts, routes, response shapes → `docs/api.md`
- development workflow, commands → `docs/development.md`
- coding conventions, best practices → `docs/conventions.md`
- CI/CD pipelines → `docs/ci-cd.md`

Module-specific implementation details live in `modules/<module>/README.md` — reference them, do not
duplicate.

---

## Definition of Done

A task is **ONLY** complete when **ALL** applicable items are satisfied:

<!-- 1. Formatting applied with `pnpm format:fix`
2. Lint autofixes applied and lint passes with `pnpm lint:fix` -->

3. TypeScript checks pass with `pnpm typecheck`
4. If server or module runtime server code changed, API surface has been reviewed
5. Documentation updated in `docs/` (single source of truth)
6. All code written or touched has proper JSDoc where applicable
7. Route and runtime contracts remain backward-compatible unless explicitly requested
8. Non-obvious architectural changes documented in `docs/`

**Important:** After completing the above, the agent **MUST NOT** commit the changes. Instead, the
agent **MUST** provide a summary of the work done, including:

- What changed
- Impact on contracts and behavior
- Open risks or follow-up work

It is the responsibility of the human collaborator to review, approve, and commit the changes.

---

## Git

- **Agents MUST NOT commit changes directly.** All changes must be reviewed and committed by a human
  collaborator.
- Use Conventional Commit messages: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` for summarizing changes
- Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `perf`,
  `revert`
